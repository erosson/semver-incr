# git-semver-incr

Several semantic versioning tools, dependent only on git and bash, created with automation in mind.

There's many semantic versioning tools out there already. (TODO: links) They're often one large tool with a mountain of configuration options, tied to a single language, and they never quite work the way I'd like them to work. Instead of one large tool, this project provides several small, specialized versioning scripts. Your workflow can use these scripts to craft and fine-tune your own versioning workflow.
